        <strong style="font-family:Arial;font-size:14px;color:darkgrey"> Hematology is the branch of medicine concerning the study of blood, the blood-forming organs, and blood diseases.
             The word "heme" comes from the Greek for blood. Hematology tests include laboratory assessments of blood formation and blood disorders.
           These include blood and bone marrow cells. Hematological tests can help diagnose anemia,
             infection, hemophilia, blood-clotting disorders, and leukemia.</strong>

                <strong style="color:#006DD9;">Some of the diseases treated by haematologists include:</strong>
                     <h5 style="color:#006DD9;"> Iron deficiency anemia</h5>

                     <p><strong style="font-family:Arial;font-size:14px;color:darkgrey">Anemia is defined as a reduced amount of red blood cells or hemoglobin in the blood, 
                    which can lead to a shortage in the amount of oxygen that is carried to various parts of the body.
                     This can lead to symptoms such as a pale appearance, weakness, fatigue, and breathlessness. 
                    In the case of iron deficiency anemia, inadequate amounts of hemoglobin (oxygen carrying compounds) are found in red blood cells.
                     Hemoglobin contains one iron molecule at its core and if this iron is missing,
                     red blood cells appear pale and small when viewed under the microscope.

                <br />Treatment to correct iron deficiency anemia involves the use of iron tablets or in severe cases,
                     iron compound injections. Pregnant women are at an increased risk of iron deficiency anemia and
                     may be prescribed iron pills during their pregnancy to meet the demands of the growing fetus.</strong>
                 </p>
               <h5 style="color:#006DD9;"> Hemoglobinopathies</h5>
                   <p><strong style="font-family:Arial;font-size:14px;color:darkgrey"> These are conditions caused by genetic defects that give rise to abnormalities in the globin chains inside a hemoglobin molecule.
                     Examples of hemoglobinopathies include sickle cell disease and thalassemia</strong></p>
                <h5 style="color:#006DD9;">Platelet and bleeding disorders</h5>
                <p><strong style="font-family:Arial;font-size:14px;color:darkgrey"> Examples of platelet and bleeding disorders that may be treated by hematologists include idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP),
                     thrombocytopenic purpura, hemophilia and Von Willebrand disease.
                    Treatment involves the use of engineered coagulation factor medications and blood transfusions.</strong></p>

                        Cancers and bone marrow disorders are also treated by hematologists and examples include leukemia,
                         lymphoma, myelodysplastic syndrome, multiple myeloma and myelofibrosis.

                        Hematologists manage the blood transfusions that may be required in various different conditions including major blood loss due to trauma.
                         Bone marrow stem cell transplantation is also managed by hematologists.
